        "Please refer to the lecture slides for pseudo-code on Bayes Opt.\n",

        "You will be using the segmentation network from last lab session and your goal would be to build a meta-learning system that can give you an optimal batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should use Bayes Opt along with the one or both networks that you trained in the last lab session to tune the batch size for one or both of the networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training with the optimal batch size, compare your first model's performance with that of the one trained using the optimal batch size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch size directly impacts the balance between training speed, generalization accuracy, and memory constraints. Too small of a batch size causes unstable training and thus poor perfomrnace, whereas too large of a batch size may take too long for training resulting in poor generalisability when trained with fixed compute budgets."
